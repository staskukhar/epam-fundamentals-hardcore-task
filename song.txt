Higher, your love has set me free
Now nothing's out of reach
Higher, higher, ooh

I run the days into the night
I feel my heart is goin' rogue here
But I kinda like it (I do)
You run your mouth, I ran a mile
I've heard it all, now you don't want me
Well I'm done, I promise

Yeah I will go
Screamin' out my pain into the night
Do what I like
I'll lose control
Shave my head and dance with girls you like
It gets me higher, you get me higher

Higher, your love has set me free
Now nothing's out of reach
Higher, higher
Higher, I'm stronger now I'm free
I'm who I wanna be
Higher, higher, ooh

Higher, higher, ooh
Higher, higher, ooh
