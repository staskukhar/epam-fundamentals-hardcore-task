Higher, your love has set me free
Now nothing's out of reach
Higher, higher, ooh

I run the days into the night
I feel my heart is goin' rogue here
But I kinda like it (I do)
You run your mouth, I ran a mile
I've heard it all, now you don't want me
Well I'm done, I promise

Yeah I will go
Screamin' out my pain into the night
Do what I like
I'll lose control
Shave my head and dance with girls you like
It gets me higher, you get me higher

Higher, your love has set me free
Now nothing's out of reach
Higher, higher
Higher, I'm stronger now I'm free
I'm who I wanna be
Higher, higher, ooh

Higher, higher, ooh
Higher, higher, ooh

I'll paint my skin with broke hearts
I'll rip our memories all apart
I lose my mind now that you're not here (I do)
Your guitar I smash it up
'Cause that's the music that I love
Play it so loud, you can hear it

Yeah I will go
Screamin' out my pain into the night
Do what I like
I'll lose control
Shave my head and dance with girls you like
It gets me higher, you get me higher

Higher, your love has set me free
Now nothing's out of reach
Higher, higher
Higher, I'm stronger now I'm free
I'm who I wanna be
Higher, higher, ooh

Higher, higher, ooh
Higher, higher, ooh

This ain't no give or take (ooh, ooh)
I've learned from my mistakes (ooh, ooh)
I'm so much stronger now (ooh, ooh)
I'm so much stronger now
This ain't no give or take (ooh, ooh)
I've learned from my mistakes (ooh, ooh)
I'm so much stronger now (ooh, ooh)
I'm so much stronger now

Higher, your love has set me free
Now nothing's out of reach
Higher, higher, ooh
Higher, your love has set me free (has set me free)
Now nothing's out of reach
Higher, higher
Higher, I'm stronger now I'm free
I'm who I wanna be
Higher, higher, ooh

This ain't no give or take (oh no)
I've learned from my mistakes (oh, oh)
I'm so much stronger now (higher, higher)
I'm so much stronger now (ooh)
This ain't no give or take (ooh, ooh)
I've learned from my mistakes (ooh, ooh)
I'm so much stronger now (oh, no no no)
I'm so much stronger now
